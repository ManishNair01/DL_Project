# Facial Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

This project performs facial emotion classification using the FER2013 dataset with two approaches:

- ✅ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- ✅ **Transfer Learning** (using pre-trained models like VGG16/ResNet)

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Source:** [FER-2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

- Contains grayscale face images (48x48)
- 7 emotion classes:
  - Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Neutral

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-recognition-dl.git
cd emotion-recognition-dl
```

### 2. Install required libraries

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras graphviz
```

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

### ▶️ CNN-Based Pipeline

1. Import libraries
2. Load and preprocess FER2013 dataset
3. Build a CNN architecture from scratch
4. Train and evaluate the model
5. Visualize results (confusion matrix, accuracy/loss curves)

### ▶️ Transfer Learning Pipeline

1. Preprocess and resize images
2. Load pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16 without top layers)
3. Add custom dense layers
4. Compile and train the model (optional: freeze base layers)
5. Evaluate and visualize results

---

## 📊 Output

* Model accuracy/loss plots
* Confusion matrix
* Classification report
* Exportable flowcharts of both pipelines
